Welcome to my **JDBC 15-Day Challenge**! 🎯  
This repository is a showcase of my growing skills in **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)** — where I connect Java applications with MySQL databases to perform real-world operations like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data. 🛠️

---

## 🔥 What’s in this Repo?

- ✅ JDBC Setup and Configuration
- ✅ Connecting to MySQL using JDBC
- ✅ CRUD Operations
- ✅ SQL Exception Handling
- ✅ Prepared Statements
- ✅ Project-level Implementations
- ✅ Real Error Fixing (like the famous `Table doesn't exist` 😉)

---

## 📅 Why 15 Days?

I wanted to level up my backend development skills 💪, and what better way than a focused **15-day challenge** where I:
- Build mini projects
- Debug real issues
- Document everything I learn!

Each day has its own folder with source code and learnings.
